	      <h2>MLRec 2017</h2>
	      <p>3<sup>rd</sup> International Workshop on Machine Learning Methods for Recommender Systems</p>
	    </header>
	    <p><b>In conjunction with <a href="http://www.siam.org/meetings/sdm17/" target="blank">17th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 2017)</a><br />
		April 27 - 29, 2017, Houston, Texas, USA</b></p>
	    
	    <p>Following the success of the last editions of MLRec in
	      <a href="http://mlrec.org/2015/">2015</a> and
	      <a href="http://mlrec.org/2016/">2016</a>,
	      the third edition of the MLRec workshop focuses on developing novel, and applying existing
	      Machine Learning (ML) and Data Mining (DM) methods to improve recommender systems.
	      This workshop also highly encourages applying ML-based recommendation
	      algorithms in novel application domains (e.g., precision medicine), and 
	      solving novel recommendation problems formulated from industry.   
	      
	      
	      The ultimate goal of the 
	      MLRec workshop series is to promote the advancement and implementation of
	      new, effective and efficient ML and DM techniques with high translational potential
	      for real and large-scale recommender systems,
	      and to expand the territory of ML-based recommender system research toward non-conventional
	      application areas where recommendation problems largely exist but haven't been fully
	      recognized. 
	      <br>
	      <br>

			      <b>Title:</b> Deconvolving Feedback Loops in Recommender Systems (<a href="slides/Gleich.pdf" target="blank">slides</a>)<br />
			      <b>Abstract:</b> 
			      Collaborative filtering is a popular technique to infer users' preferences on new content based on the collective information of all users preferences. Recommender systems then use this information to make personalized suggestions to users. When users accept these recommendations it creates a feedback loop in the recommender system, and these loops iteratively influence the collaborative filtering algorithm's predictions over time. We investigate whether it is possible to identify items affected by these feedback loops. We state sufficient assumptions to deconvolve the feedback loops while keeping the inverse solution tractable. We furthermore develop a metric to unravel the recommender system's influence on the entire user-item rating matrix. We use this metric on synthetic and real-world datasets to (1) identify the extent to which the recommender system affects the final rating matrix, (2) rank frequently recommended items, and (3) distinguish whether a user's rated item was recommended or an intrinsic preference. Our results indicate that it is possible to recover the ratings matrix of intrinsic user preferences using a single snapshot of the ratings matrix without any temporal information.<br />

			      <b>Title:</b> The Dueling Bandits Problem (<a href="slides/Yue.pdf" target="blank">slides</a>)<br />
			      <b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, I will present the Dueling Bandits Problem, which is an online learning framework tailored towards real-time learning from subjective human feedback. In particular, the Dueling Bandits Problem only requires pairwise comparisons, which are shown to be reliably inferred in a variety of subjective feedback settings such as for information retrieval and recommender systems. I will provide an overview of the Dueling Bandits Problem with basic algorithmic results. I will then conclude by discussing some ongoing research directions with applications to personalized medicine.

			      This is joint work with Josef Broder, Bobby Kleinberg, Thorsten Joachims, Yanan Sui, Vincent Zhuang, and Joel Burdick.<br /> 

			      <b>Bio: </b>Yisong Yue is an assistant professor in the Computing and Mathematical Sciences Department at the California Institute of Technology. He was previously a research scientist at Disney Research. Before that, he was a postdoctoral researcher in the Machine Learning Department and the iLab at Carnegie Mellon University. He received a Ph.D. from Cornell University and a B.S. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

			      Yisong's research interests lie primarily in the theory and application of statistical machine learning. He is particularly interested in developing novel methods for spatiotemporal reasoning, structured prediction, interactive learning systems, and learning with humans in the loop. In the past, his research has been applied to information retrieval, recommender systems, text classification, learning from rich user interfaces, analyzing implicit human feedback, data-driven animation, behavior analysis, sports analytics, policy learning in robotics, and adaptive routing & allocation problems.

			      <b>Title:</b> Building Recommenders and Search Engines by Re-using Logged User Feedback (<a href="slides/Adith.pdf" target="blank">slides</a>)<br />
			      <b>Abstract:</b> Interactive systems like search engines, recommender systems, and ad placement platforms are ubiquitous.Evaluating and optimizing these systems is hard ---users' feedback governs system performance, and gathering their feedback in randomized experiments is costly.I study how we can use logs collected from deployed systems to perform offline evaluation and learning. I will outline two projects (Viewing Recommendations as Treatments, ICML'16
and De-biasing Learning to Rank, WSDM'17) that advance the state of the art for these problems.<br /> 

			      <b>Bio: </b>Adith Swaminathan is a researcher in the Deep Learning Technology Center at Microsoft Research Redmond. He completed his PhD at Cornell University advised by Prof. Thorsten Joachims, and received a BTech from IIT Bombay. His graduate thesis developed machine learning algorithms for interactive systems, like search engines and recommender systems, that re-use logs collected from user interactions in a principled manner. Adith's research agenda centers around imbuing current machine learning practice with causal reasoning, so that they can go beyond prediction to intervene reliably in interactive settings.

			      <b>Title:</b>Recommender Systems in an Advertising Platform (<a href="slides/Suju.pdf" target="blank">slides</a>)<br />
			      <b>Abstract:</b> In a Real Time Bidding ad platform, figuring out the right ad to show to an user needs to happen in <100ms. This involves deciding the advertiser & product combination that the user is most likely to interact with. Specifically, we need to recommend a set of products from a combined catalog of ~3B products for more than a billion users. In this talk, I will introduce the recommender system in our RTB platform, the constraints under which it operates and speak to some of the approaches we have experimented with. I will also present some of the challenges we have faced and highlight the research work in solving these problems.
