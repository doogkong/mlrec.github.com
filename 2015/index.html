								</header>
								<p><b>In conjunction with <a href="http://www.siam.org/meetings/sdm15/" target="blank">15th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 2015)</a><br />
								      May 2, 2015, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada</b></p>
								<p>The proceeding of MLRec'15 is now available for <a href="mlrec15note.pdf"><b>download</b></a>.</p>

								<p>This workshop focuses on applying novel as well as existing machine learning and data mining methodologies for improving recommender systems. There are many established conferences such as NIPS and ICML that focus on the study of theoretical properties of machine learning algorithms. On the other hand, the recent developed conference ACM RecSys focuses on different aspects of designing and implementing recommender systems. We believe that there is a gap between these two ends, and this workshop aims at bridging the recent advances of machine learning and data mining algorithms to improving recommender systems. Since many recommendation approaches are built upon data mining and machine learning algorithms, these approaches are deeply rooted in their foundations. As such, there is an urgent need for researchers from the two communities to jointly work on 1) what are the recent developed machine learning and data mining techniques that can be leveraged to address challenges in recommender systems, and 2) from challenges in recommender systems, what are the practical research directions in the machine learning and data mining community.</p>

								<h4>Topics of Interest</h4>

								<b>Title:</b> MF (Matrix Factorization) and FM (Factorization Machines) for Recommender Systems<br /> 
								<b>Abstract:</b> MF (Matrix Factorization) and FM (Factorization Machines) are both
								effective methods for Recommender Systems. In the first part of this
								talk, we focus on MF that assumes the ratings from users to items are
								the only given information. We discuss our recent efforts in
								developing a parallel package LIBMF for shared-memory
								systems. Currently, stochastic gradient (SG) method is one of the most
								popular algorithms to solve the optimization problem for MF. However,
								as a sequential approach, SG is difficult to be parallelized. We
								carefully reduce the cache-miss rate and address the load balance of
								threads to have an effective parallel SG implementation. Further,
								because the performance of SG highly depends on the setting of
								learning rates, we develop some adaptive approaches to achieve fast
								and stable convergence. Experiments show that our implementation
								outperforms available parallel matrix factorization packages. In the
								second part of the talk, we consider situations where some user or
								item features are also available. FM (Factorization Machines) is a
								useful model in such situations. Recently an extension of FM called
								FFM (Field-aware FM) has been shown to be very effective for CTR
								predictions in computational advertising. We discuss our group
								members' winning approaches for two Kaggle competitions on CTR
								predictions. Our work has been released in another package LIBFFM for
							public use.	<br />

								<b>Title:</b> Probabilistic Graphical Models for Recommendation in Social Media <br /> 
								<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, we will take a closer look at two key ingredients of social media, social networks and location-based services, and investigate how to model their properties for effective item and location recommendation. In the social sciences, the effects of social influence (friends tend to become more similar to each other), and homophily or selection (people tend to befriend similar people) have been identified as drivers of the dynamics of social networks. In the first part of the talk we will discuss methods for exploiting these effects for improving the accuracy of item recommendation in social networks. In the second main part of the talk, we will explore another key aspect of social media, namely location-based social networks (LBSN). A key effect in LBSN is geographical influence, which means that nearby locations have more similar features than far away locations.  Location recommendation is different in nature from traditional item recommendation, since the check-in at a physical location requires more commitment from a user than the adoption of an item such as a movie. We will present probabilistic graphical models to capture these properties for location recommendation. The talk will discuss related research with a focus on our own work. In the conclusion, we will outline interesting directions for future research in the fascinating field of recommendation in social media. <br />

								<b>Jieping Ye</b>, University of Michigan <br /> 
								<b>Title:</b> Orthogonal Rank-One Matrix Pursuit for Low Rank Matrix Completion <br /> 
								<b>Abstract:</b> Low rank matrix learning has recently attracted significant attentions in machine learning and data mining due to its wide range of applications, such as collaborative filtering, dimensionality reduction, compressed sensing, and multi-task learning. In this talk, we consider the general form of low rank matrix completion: given a partially observed real-valued matrix Y, we aim to find a matrix X with minimum rank that best approximates the matrix Y on the observed elements. As it is intractable to minimize the matrix rank exactly in the general case, many approximate solutions have been proposed to attack the problem. A widely used convex relaxation of matrix rank is the trace norm or the nuclear norm. The resulting optimization problem is, however, computationally expensive for large matrices. In this talk, we present an efficient and scalable low rank matrix completion algorithm. The key idea is to extend the orthogonal matching pursuit method from the vector case to the matrix case. The algorithm achieves a linear convergence rate, which is significantly better than the previous known results. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on several large-scale datasets, including the Netflix and MovieLens datasets.  <br />

								<b>Junling Hu</b>, Samsung Research<br /> 
								<b>Title:</b> Large-scale recommender systems based on Learning to Rank <br /> 
								<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, I will discuss research effort of approaching recommender problems as learning to rank problems. Here recommendation is treated as ranking, where the ranking function is learned with historical data and can be updated with new data. This approach has 2 major advantages: First, it enables us to include many factors as learning features, including the collaborative filtering factors, thus creating a universal way to handle recommendation problem. Second, it allows us to take advantage of distributed computing through parallel learning methods.  I will describe our work in building TV recommender systems with this approach, and how it is built in the parallel framework of Spark. Our system is scalable with increasing amount of data, and is shown to have better performance than standard collaborative filtering based on matrix factorization.  <br />
